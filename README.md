# TCP-UDP-Client-Server-Aplication
A client–server messaging platform built with TCP and UDP sockets, implementing a publish–subscribe model for efficient message management. The server acts as a broker between UDP publishers and TCP subscribers, supporting topic-based subscriptions with wildcard matching and real-time message delivery.
